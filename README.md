# Git Setup & Workflow Guide

This guide provides a complete reference for setting up and using Git effectively, whether from the terminal or directly in VS Code.

## ðŸ”¹ Initial Setup

* Configure user details (`user.name`, `user.email`) for commit attribution.
* Set VS Code as the default Git editor.
* Handle cross-platform line endings with `core.autocrlf`.
* Edit global configuration easily via `git config --global -e`.

## ðŸ”¹ Repository Initialization

* Create a repository with `git init` (console) or **Initialize Repository** in VS Code Source Control.

## ðŸ”¹ Working with Files

* **Stage & commit** files using `git add` + `git commit` (console) or Source Control panel in VS Code.
* Use `git status` to track staged/unstaged changes.

## ðŸ”¹ Reviewing Changes

* Compare changes with `git diff`, `git diff --staged`, or `git diff HEAD`.
* In VS Code, view side-by-side diffs before committing.

## ðŸ”¹ Branching Best Practices

* Always keep `main` stable and production-ready.
* Never commit directly to `main`.
* Use descriptive branch names (`feature/login-auth`, `bugfix/payment-error`).
* Regularly sync with `main`, keep branches short-lived, and merge via PRs.

## ðŸ”¹ Working with Remotes

* Add, view, change, or remove GitHub remotes (`git remote add origin <url>`).
* Push changes using `git push -u origin main`.

## ðŸ”¹ Ignoring Files

* Use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files (logs, cache, `.env`, `dist/`).
* Example:

  ```gitignore
  __pycache__/
  .vscode/
  .env
  dist/
  *.log
  ```

## ðŸ”¹ Undoing Changes

* **Revert** (safe): Creates a new commit to undo changes â†’ best for shared repos.
* **Reset** (risky): Moves `HEAD` to a previous commit â†’ useful for local cleanups before pushing.

âœ… With this setup, you can confidently initialize projects, manage commits, branch safely, work with remotes, ignore sensitive files, and revert or reset changes when needed.

Would you like me to make this **short (2â€“3 paragraphs)** for a neat README introduction, or keep this **sectioned format** as a reference guide inside the README?
